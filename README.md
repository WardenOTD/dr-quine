# Quines

A quine is a self replicating program. \
Basically, when ran it outputs it's own source code.

---

It can be used as a simple computor virus, a malicious program that keeps reproducing by duplicating itself. \
Essentially doubling everytime it runs.

# Pain

This project has really cemented the fact that your biggest enemy is yourself, \
And that the printf family of functions hurt my brain.

**_Using C functions within assembly with the whole pie/pic shenanigans is rather annoying._**
